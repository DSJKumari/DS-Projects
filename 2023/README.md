# Binary Classification for Ionosphere Dataset

The Ionosphere dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consists of radar data, which is used to classify whether a signal shows evidence of structure in the ionosphere. This classification problem typically involves predicting whether the radar returns indicate a "good" or "bad" signal, where "good" signals are those showing some type of structure and "bad" signals are those showing no structure.

The project effectively demonstrates how to load this dataset, preprocess it, and apply three different machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the radar signals. Each model's performance is then evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices, showcasing a practical approach to handling real-world classification problems.
